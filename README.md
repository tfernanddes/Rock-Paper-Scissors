## Rock Paper Scissors

Made a simple rock, paper, scissors game.

Inside the `main.py` file, there are three ASCII arts for the hand signals assigned to corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. This will make it easy to print them out to the console.

Started the game by asking to the user

_"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."_

From there:

- Created a var to the user's input.
- Generated a random choice for the computer.
- Compared the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
- And also gave a feedback to the player.
